    <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is built on the concept of
                    "objects," which can include data in the form of fields (also known as attributes) and code in the
                    form of procedures (also known as methods). For example, a person is an item with specific
                    characteristics such as height, gender, age, and so on. It also has options such as moving,
                    chatting, and so on..</p>
                <h6>Object</h6>
                <p>This is the basic unit of object-focused program. That both the data and the data processing function
                    are grouped together as a unit called an object.</p>
                <h6>Class</h6>
                <p>You create an object plan when you create a category. This does not imply any data, but it does
                    clarify what the class's name implies, namely, what the class object would contain and what
                    functions it can do.
                    OOP is entirely built on four fundamental notions. Let's take a good look at each other -</p>

                        <h6>Abstraction</h6>
                        <p> To put it another way, they only reveal critical information to the outside world while
                            keeping their background information hidden. A web server, for example, conceals how it
                            processes the data it gets; the end user merely navigates to the end and retrieves the
                            data. </p>
                        <h6>Encapsulation</h6>
                        <p>
                            The process of combining data members (variables, structures) and member functions (methods)
                            into a single entity is known as integration. It's also a means to restrict access to
                            certain areas or structures. Class is the best illustration of encapsulation.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Polymorphism</h6>
                        <p>
                            Polymorphism is a noun that refers to polygamy. A polymorphism usually happens when there is
                            a categorization and it is linked to heredity. The polymorphism of C++ means that depending
                            on the type of work being called, a member's calling of a member will result in a different
                            function.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Inheritance</h6>
                        <p>
                            An inheritance is the ability to establish a new class in an existing classroom. Using the
                            heritage, we can create a Child class from the parent category that inherits the parent
                            category's structures and methods while also adding its own features and methods. For
                            example, if we have a class car with attributes such as Color, Price, and so on, we can
                            create two classes, one for a bike and one for a car, each with those two buildings and
                            other designated qualities such as the car having number windows while the bike does not.
                            The same can be said about approaches.

                        <p>
                            A constructor is a method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that
                            initializes a freshly produced object of that kind. The constructor is automatically invoked
                            when an object is created.

                        <p>Correction is a nice word for sample data. Modification allows you to fill your test data
                            with pre-defined data before the start of your test. Adjustments are independent and are
                            written via YAML.

                        </p>
                        <h6>Namespace</h6>
                        <p>A namespace is a marketing area that allows identifiers (type names, functions, variations,
                            and so on) to be placed within it. Word spaces are used to organize code into logical groups
                            and to avoid word conflicts, which might happen when working with several libraries.</p>
