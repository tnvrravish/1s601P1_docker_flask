                <p>Pylint is a tool for checking Python code for errors, enforcing coding standards, and detecting code
                    smells. It may also look for specific type errors, make suggestions for refactoring individual
                    blocks, and provide information about the code's complexity.

                    Pylint is a Python code error checker that also tries to enforce coding standards and detects code
                    smells. It can also identify issues, make recommendations for how certain blocks might be rebuilt,
                    and provide information about the code's complexity.

                            Pylint checks if the user is following all PEP8 standards, wheather required modules are
                            used and sufficient spacing and dockstrings are placed.
                            This creates a sense of uniformity across code writtend all over the world following certain
                            standards.

                            It, like other tools, is prone to generating redundant code. The process of resetting an
                            existing code without affecting its exterior behavior or performance is known as code reset.
                            The software's design, structure, and usefulness are all improved by redesigning it.

                            Pylint is not wiser than you, and what he says should not be taken as gospel. Pylint may
                            warn you about things you have done conscientiously. Pylint makes every attempt to report as
                            few false positives for faults as possible, although it may be overly careful with warnings.
                            That's because it's trying to figure out what's detrimental in one context but not in
                            another, or it's looking for stuff you don't care about. In general, Pylint will not remain
                            completely silent about your code, so don't be surprised if your project generates a flurry
                            of alerts.
