                <p>CI/CD is a means of delivering apps to clients more frequently by incorporating automation into the
                    app development process. Continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment are
                    the three key principles associated with CI/CD. CI/CD is a solution to the challenges that
                    development and operations teams face while integrating new code.

                            Inside the prod.yml and dev.yml files we set some triggers such that some CI/CD actions take
                            place when certain events occur.

                            Whenever a pull request is created to merge a branch into master. Development CI/CD workflow
                            is initated.
                            The branch code that is being merged is tested using pytest and then deployed using the
                            development server.
                            The status of the code can be verified using the dev server and if all the requirements are
                            met.
                            The branch is merged.

                        <h6> Production Setup </h6>
                        <p>
                            Production CI/CD workflow is triggered whenever a push command is issued to the master
                            branch in the repository.
                            Initially the code is tested using the tests created by the developer.
                            Once the tests have been successfully passed.
                            Docker image is build and a copy of that image is pushed to the docker hub repository.
                            <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tnvrravish/project_1">Docker Hub
                                Repository</a>
                            After successfully pushing the image to the repository the project is deployed to the
                            production server.
                            Only after successfully completing all the above three conditions. The CI/CD process is
                            considered successful.
